Events & Delegates
------------------
Delegates--- Why,What & How?
What are Delegates?
Delegates type safe function pointers.

function----functionality

(Address)pointer--->point--->functionality

delegate----->address of the functionality
type safe----- > Generics
List<int> ----> only ints
delegate---- typesafe function pointer---->
(Delegates)they will allow you to point to the function 
if the delegate signature matches the function signature.

Where to use Delegates?
1)Event handling
2)call backs
3)multi-threading
4)function lambdas & action lambdas are based on delegates

Why?
1) They are type safe
2) No Dangling pointers

How?
delegate  is a keyword-- System
It is a reference type

public void m1(int i,int j){}
public delegate void d1(int i,int j);

public float returnData(string custname);
public delegate float d1(string customername);

Where to declare a delegate?
1) inside the class
2) outside the class(inside the namespace)

Types---
1) Unicast--- points to single method
2) Multicast----points to multiple methods----return type of 
multicast delegate is always void
