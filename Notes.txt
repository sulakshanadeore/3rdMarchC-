Serialization
It is a process of persisting(write) the data to a file as a object, 
reading it back- Deserialization

For serialization:

1) Class must be marked as Serializable(), using the attribute

[Serilizable()]
Class Customer
{


}

this gives the right to the object to be written to a file.
2) If a certain property value must be ignored while writing the 
object data to the file, that property VARIABLE must be marked as 
[NonSerialized()]


Types of Serialization
1)XML--- using System.Xml.Serialization
2)Binary--- using System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary
3)Json---using System.Text.Json
