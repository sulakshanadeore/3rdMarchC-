WPF/WCF & WF r additions to .NET Framework in 3.0
WCF- Indigo
WCF is used for creating REST ful services
REST-- Representational State Transfer
HttpGet/HttpPost--- web projects
WCF is create services to transfer data over the network, and moreover the
it can work over any protocol.

Remoting---- http/tcp for communication
Web Services---http/https---xml
WCF Services---- tcpip,http, https,udp,etc
			xml,json

Web API---- multiple devices support--- http
								xml/json

								WCF
=====================================================================
Windows Communication Foundation---free and open source
It is used to create distributed and interoperable Application.
This is a framework----- SOA(Service Oriented Architecture).

1) Distributed Apps
2) Interoperable 
Rishav	--http						Tunir----tcp
(Multiply,Addition)			     (Addition,Subtraction)
Class A						
{
(Multiply,Addition)
}




Class B
{
Addition ,Subtraction
}


-------------------------------------
Interface ---- Contract

Interface Mixed
{
[OperationContract]
Addition ,Subtraction,
Multiply

}



Class C:Mixed---- 
{
Addition();
Subtraction();
Multiplication();


}


Class D:Mixed
{
Subtraction

}

Class E:Mixed
{

ABC of WCF
A-Address
B- Binding-- protocol
C-Contract

Client ------Server1(http)-------Server2(tcpip)
A-Address  -----A-Address------Address
B- Binding ------B--Binding----- Binding
C-Contract-------------------------------Contract

Plan 1-A&S -----500
Plan 2-A&M -----500
Plan 3-M&S-------M & S

Parts of App
1) WCF Service---what is the service and what is it providing
2) WCF Service Host----- Where is service hosted
3) Service Client------- Who is the client of the service

Ios/Android/http-- server-----

Binding-----mechanism of data travel -- http

Fundamentals
------------
Message---- 
client					Server
			Request-----------------Envelope----packets
	Header-------address
	Body--data transmision

Endpoint
<endpoint address="" binding="" contract=""/>
 A				A
B				B
C				C
Schema://domain:port/path
http://localhost:34234/MyService
net.tcp://localhost:2342/MyService

contract----
functionality & operation is provided by the service is called as contract.
It is exposed using interfacename

hosting:
IIS
WAS
Self Hosting

SOAP----(Simple Object Access Protocol)
It is not a transport protocol but XML based language  used for message exchange.

using System.ServiceModel
using System.Configuration
using System.Runtime.Serialization
using System.Web.ApplicationServices
using System.EnterpriseServices
---------------------------------------------------------

Steps
1) Take WCF service app
2) check out for namespaces
3) create interface methods
4) if required create classes such as employees
5) inherit interface in the service class
implement the interface
Buid the WCF Service app
Execute the app--- from the service.svc window(WCF Test Client)
or interface window(Browser)

Copy the address of the service
------------------------------
KEEP THE SERVICE RUNNING
-------------------------

SERVICE CLIENT
--------------
Take WEB APP
Add service reference from References-- put the service address and get the service
reference
create of proxy object of service class and invoke methods.
